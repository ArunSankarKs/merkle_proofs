## What is a Merkle Proof ?

A Merkle proof, also known as a Merkle tree proof or a Merkle branch, is a method of proving that a specific transaction or piece of data exists within a larger set of transactions or data, without revealing the entire set. This is done by creating a tree of hashes, where each leaf node represents a transaction or piece of data, and each non-leaf node is the hash of its children. A Merkle proof consists of the set of hashes that link a leaf node to the root of the tree, and can be verified by recomputing the hashes and comparing them to the proof.
